*** Jorisd: It is patched to relax permissions on file/directory creation ***

1.7 (2013-01-05)
    - -k now specifies an environment variable that contains the
      server key. This behaviour has been changed in order to not
      expose the password in the process list.
    - Fix parsing of JOIN messages for certain servers.
      Thanks Ivan Kanakarakis!
    - Use , rather than _ for slash characters in channel names.
      As per RFC , is not allowed in a channel name, while _ is.
      Thanks plomplomplom and Nils Dagsson Moskopp!

1.6 (2011-01-31):
    - fix regression introduced for handling unknown commands

1.5 (2011-01-24):
    - fix channel name comparison in add_channel(), compare lowercase
      to prevent leaking file descriptors in the long run => Thanks samurai!
    - only handle commands ii explicitely understands and treat the rest
      as raw irc (only worked for raw commands in capital lettersin the past) => Thanks samurai!
    - create in FIFO on receiving a privmsg directly instead of requiring a new
      /j command first => Thanks Evan Gates
      this also implies that in FIFOs aren't deleted on channel leaves any longer because
      this itself creates a channel event again which in turn would recreate the file
    - minor changes

1.4 (2008-08-09):
    - fix directory traversal on servers that support SAJOIN
      NOTE: not marking as security relevant as it is only possible to
      create directories outside (which is of course annoying) of the irc
      hierarchy but not overwriting arbitrary files with the channel name.
    - documentation fixes
    - general cleanup

1.3 (2007-07-14):
    - server messages about users (QUIT,JOIN) will no longer
      go to the user directories but to the server out file to
      give an easy method to monitor it and to prevent spamming
      the irc directory.

1.2 (2007-06-23):
    - Exit on channel creation failure, thanks Michael Prokop
    - Implemented joining of password protected channels
    - Removed -v option from the manpage since it's not implemented
